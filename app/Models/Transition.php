 * linking directly to the modern Equipment model.
 * Includes audit trails and soft deletion.
 *
 * @property int $id
 * @property int $equipment_id Foreign key to the equipment asset involved in the transition ('equipment' table).

 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon $handed_date Date when the equipment was handed out to the employee.
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $return_date Date when the equipment was returned by the employee (null if not yet returned).
 * @property string|null $center_document_number Document number from the center/department related to the transition (nullable).
 * @property string|null $reason The reason for the transition (nullable string).
 * @property string|null $note Additional notes about the transition (nullable text field).
 * @property int|null $created_by Foreign key to the user who created the record.
 * @property int|null $updated_by Foreign key to the user who last updated the record.
 * @property int|null $deleted_by Foreign key to the user who soft deleted the record.
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $created_at Automatically managed timestamp for creation.
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $updated_at Automatically managed timestamp for last update.
 * @property \Illuminate\Support\Carbon|null $deleted_at The timestamp when the transition record was soft deleted.
 *

 * @property-read \App\Models\Equipment $equipment The equipment asset model involved in the transition record.
 * @property-read \App\Models\User|null $createdBy The user who created the record (if trait adds this).
 * @property-read \App\Models\User|null $deletedBy The user who soft deleted the record (if trait adds this).
